# java-todos

A student that completes this project shows that they can
* perform CRUD operations on an RDBMS using JPA and Hibernate.
* implement a data seeding class using JPA and Hibernate
* use JPA and Hibernate to perform advanced query operations on a RDBMS.
* add relationships between tables.
* implement Spring Security and OAuth2. to provide authentication for a project.

Specifically
* Seed Data
* CRUD Operations
* Exception Handling
* Logging (Tomcat Root)
* H2 Connections
* Authentication


## Introduction

This is a basic todo database scheme with users and a todo list.

## Instructions

Create a REST api service to store and read data from H2 database. 
* seeddata.java is a sample script that can be modified to populate the database 
* note that all new todos default to completed = false;

The table layouts are as follows:

* All tables should have audit fields / columns - createby createddate modifiedby modifieddate

* TODO
  * todoid primary key, not null long
  * description string, not null
  * datestarted datetime
  * completed boolean
  * userid foreign key (one user to many todos) not null 

* USERS
  * userid primary key, not null long
  * username string, not null unique
  * password string, not null

* ROLES
  * roleid primary key, not null long
  * rolename string not null unique

* USERROLES
  * roleid foreign key to role
  * userid foreign key to user
  

Expose the following end points

* GET /users/mine - return the user and todo based off of the authenticated user. You can only look up your own.
* POST /users - adds a user. Can only be done by an admin.
* POST /users/todo/{userid} - adds a todo to the assigned user. Can be done by any user.
* PUT /todos/todoid/{todoid} - updates a todo based on todoid. Can be done by any user.
* DELETE /users/userid/{userid} - Deletes a user based off of their userid and deletes all their associated todos. Can only be done by an admin.

* hint - think about taking the project https://github.com/LambdaSchool/java-oauth2.git and modifying it to fit this application
 * StartHere is a base Java Spring Back end system still under development. However, it does contain what you need for today.
 * authenticatedusers is a OAuth2 Java Spring application like we did during the guided projects but contains quotes in a many to one relationship with users.

## Stretch goals

Add appropriate exception handling especially

* a resource is not found
* the wrong data type is used for a path variable
* a non-handled endpoint is accessed (a URL not found exception)

Add logging for
* Tomcat 
* Root
* Specific application logging whenever a todo is added. Include the text of the todo, the time and date it is added and its id number.
* All logging can do to the console

* Update the end points below:
  * POST /users/todo/{userid} - adds a todo to the assigned user. Can only be done by the authenticated user. A user can only modify their own data.
  * PUT /todos/todoid/{todoid} - updates a todo based on todoid. Can only be done by the authenticated user. A user can only modify their own data.
* add appropriate end points to manage users giving only admin access to these.
* Deploy to Heroku using H2
